<p class="glossary-page">Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an intensive, community-based mental health service model designed for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) who struggle to engage in traditional treatment. It provides person-centered, multidisciplinary care, integrating psychiatric treatment, case management, vocational support, housing assistance, and substance use treatment to promote stability and recovery. ACT primarily serves individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, co-occurring disorders, frequent hospitalizations, justice involvement, or homelessness, ensuring they receive continuous, flexible, and proactive support. Unlike traditional clinical settings, ACT services are delivered directly in the community—homes, shelters, workplaces, and justice-related environments—offering accessible, wraparound care. By reducing hospitalizations, homelessness, and crisis episodes, ACT improves individual well-being, alleviates caregiver burden, and eases the strain on healthcare and social service systems, ultimately fostering long-term stability and recovery.

A transport order only lasts ten days, so make sure you give as much information as possible to assist in finding the individual.

<div class= "info-box"><p>We’ve reached the end of the second order for mental health treatment. At this stage, does the individual still meet the criteria for AOT?</p><p>PCM 218a Petition for Continuing Mental Health Treatment Order must be filed with the probate court no less than 14 days before the expiration of the second order. Consider what has happened in the past when the individual was not compliant with treatment. Look to see if there are past patterns of noncompliance that led to hospitalizations. Is their insight and understanding of their mental illness good, fair, or poor? What is different now versus when they were placed on the order?</p>

It provides person-centered, multidisciplinary care, integrating psychiatric treatment, case management, vocational support, housing assistance, and substance use treatment to promote stability and recovery. ACT primarily serves individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, co-occurring disorders, frequent hospitalizations, justice involvement, or homelessness, ensuring they receive continuous, flexible, and proactive support. Unlike traditional clinical settings, ACT services are delivered directly in the community—homes, shelters, workplaces, and justice-related environments—offering accessible, wraparound care. By reducing hospitalizations, homelessness, and crisis episodes, ACT improves individual well-being, alleviates caregiver burden, and eases the strain on healthcare and social service systems, ultimately fostering long-term stability and recovery.</p><p><strong>ASSIST</strong><br>Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test</p><p><strong>Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT)</strong><br>Assisted Outpatient Treatment is different categories of outpatient services ordered by the court under section 468 or 469a.
